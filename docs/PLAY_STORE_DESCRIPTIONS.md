## Full Description

**Personal 12 step recovery tools - made by a sober member of AA**

I created this app suite for myself to work through AA's steps and maintain my recovery practice. These are NOT official AA tools - just my personal approach to working the program. Sharing them freely in case others find them helpful.

**Six Recovery Tools:**
✓ **4th Step Inventory** - Fearless moral inventory with "Theatre of the Lies" flavor
✓ **8th Step Amends** - List of persons to make amends to
✓ **Morning Ritual** - Daily meditation and prayer routine with timers
✓ **Evening Ritual** - Daily 10th step reflection and inventory
✓ **Gratitude Journal** - Daily gratitude practice
✓ **Surrender & Correction** - What I haven't given to God & corrective attitudes

**Features:**
✓ Completely FREE - No ads, subscriptions, or hidden costs
✓ Privacy-first - Data stays on your device unless you choose Google Drive backup
✓ Simple form-based entry for all tools
✓ Export/import JSON files
✓ English and Danish language support
✓ Cross-device sync via optional Google Drive
✓ Switch between all 6 tools seamlessly
✓ Context-sensitive help for each tool

**Important:**
• UNOFFICIAL tools - not affiliated with AA Worldwide, but made with respect
• Created by me as a sober member of AA for my own personal recovery
• Always follow your sponsor's guidance for step work
• Supplements but doesn't replace traditional methods, the Big Book, and your sponsor
• Read the manual (hint: it's a blue book 📘)

**Privacy:**
• Local storage by default
• Optional Google Drive uses private app folder
• No tracking, analytics, or data sharing
• Full control - export, backup, or delete anytime
• All 6 tools sync to one encrypted Drive file

I made this because pen-and-paper didn't work well for me. If you prefer digital tools, these might help your recovery process. Will always be free - in my opinion, recovery tools should be accessible to all.

Your sponsor is your best guide. These are just tools - the real work happens between you, your higher power, and your sponsor.

**Theater of the Lies Approach:**
The 4th Step tool includes an optional "I Am" framework that helps identify false beliefs and character defects. This is my personal take on inventory work - use what helps, discard what doesn't.
