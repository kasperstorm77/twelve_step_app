## Full Description

**Personal 12 step app - made by a sober member of AA**

I created this app for myself to work through AA's 4th Step. This is NOT official AA - just my personal approach to doing a fearless moral inventory. Sharing it freely in case others find it helpful, it has a theatre of the lies flavour, that i personally find valuable, it's optional to use.

**Features:**
✓ Track 4th step inventory
✓ Completely FREE - No ads, subscriptions, or hidden costs
✓ Privacy-first - Data stays on your device unless you choose Google Drive backup to your personal drive.
✓ Simple form-based entry for Step 4 work
✓ Export/import JSON files
✓ English and Danish language support
✓ Cross-device sync via optional Google Drive (windows application also created)

**Important:**
• UNOFFICIAL tool - not affiliated with AA Worldwide, but hopefully accepted 
• Created by me as a sober member of AA for myself as a personal project  
• Always follow your sponsor's guidance for Step 4, this is but a supplement
• Supplements but doesn't replace traditional methods, follow the guideline of your sponsor and you higher power - and read the manual :) - hint, it's a blue book :)

**Privacy:**
• Local storage by default
• Optional Google Drive uses private app folder
• No tracking, analytics, or data sharing
• Full control - export, backup, or delete anytime

I made this because pen-and-paper didn't work well for me. If you prefer digital tools, this might help your Step 4 process. Will always be free - in my opinion, recovery tools should be accessible to all.

Your sponsor is your best guide. This is just a tool - the real work happens between you, your higher power, and your sponsor.
