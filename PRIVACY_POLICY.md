# Privacy Policy for the 12 steps app

**Effective Date**: October 13th 2025  
**Last Updated**: December 2nd 2025

## About This App

The Twelve Steps App is a comprehensive recovery toolkit designed for the AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) program. This app provides six integrated tools: 4th Step Inventory, 8th Step Amends, Morning Ritual, Evening Ritual, Gratitude Journal, and Agnosticism Papers. All apps help users manage their recovery work locally on their device with optional Google Drive cloud backup.

## Information We Collect

### Personal Information
- **Google Account Information**: If you choose to enable Google Drive sync, we access your Google account email and display name solely for authentication purposes.
- **Recovery Data**: The app stores your personal recovery data (resentments, amends, rituals, gratitude entries, and spiritual reflections) that you voluntarily enter across all six integrated apps.

### Technical Information
- **App Version Data**: The app stores version information locally to detect updates and offer data sync prompts.
- **Sync Preferences**: Your choice to enable or disable Google Drive synchronization is stored locally.

## How We Use Your Information

### Local Storage
- All inventory entries are stored locally on your device using secure local database storage (Hive)
- Your data remains on your device unless you explicitly enable Google Drive sync
- No data is transmitted to external servers without your explicit consent

### Google Drive Integration (Optional)
When you choose to enable Google Drive sync:
- Your inventory data is encrypted and stored in your personal Google Drive App Data folder
- This folder is private to the app and not accessible to other applications or users
- Data is only synchronized when you explicitly enable this feature
- You can disable sync at any time, and your local data remains unaffected

### File Operations
- CSV export creates files on your device's storage for backup purposes
- CSV import reads files from your device to restore data
- File operations require storage permissions but data remains local to your device

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

### What We Don't Share
- We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties
- We do not share your inventory data with any external services except Google Drive (when enabled by you)
- We do not use analytics, tracking, or advertising services
- We do not collect usage statistics or behavioral data

### Google Drive Integration
- When sync is enabled, data is transmitted securely to Google Drive using Google's official APIs
- Data is stored in your personal Google Drive App Data folder, which is:
  - Private to this app only
  - Not visible in your regular Drive files
  - Protected by Google's security infrastructure
  - Accessible only to you through this app

## Your Data Rights

### Control Over Your Data
- **Local Storage**: All data remains on your device by default
- **Sync Control**: You can enable/disable Google Drive sync at any time
- **Data Export**: Export your data to CSV format at any time
- **Data Deletion**: Clear all data through the app's settings or by uninstalling the app

### Account Management
- **Google Sign-In**: Sign in or out of your Google account at any time
- **Sync Disable**: Turning off sync does not delete your local data
- **Account Removal**: Signing out removes access to cloud sync but preserves local data

## Data Security

### Local Security
- Data is stored using secure local database encryption
- No data transmission occurs without explicit user consent
- App follows Flutter/Android security best practices

### Cloud Security
- Google Drive integration uses OAuth 2.0 authentication
- All communications with Google Drive are encrypted (HTTPS/TLS)
- We use Google's official APIs with restricted app data scope
- Data is stored in Google's secure infrastructure when sync is enabled

## Data Retention

### Local Data
- Data persists on your device until you choose to delete it or uninstall the app
- You have full control over data retention through the app's clear data function

### Cloud Data
- When Google Drive sync is enabled, data is retained in your Google Drive until you:
  - Disable sync and delete cloud data
  - Remove the app's access permissions in your Google Account settings
  - Delete your Google account

## Permissions Explained

### Required Permissions
- **Storage Access**: Required for CSV import/export functionality
- **Internet Access**: Required for optional Google Drive synchronization

### Optional Features
- **Google Drive Access**: Only requested when you choose to enable sync
- **Google Account Information**: Only accessed when you sign in for sync features
